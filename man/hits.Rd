\title{Hyperlink-induced topic search}
\usage{
hits(adjmatrix, maxiter = 100L, tol = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjmatrix}{an adjacency matrix}

\item{maxiter}{non-negative integer}

\item{tol}{positive numeric value to be used as tolerance threshold for convergence}
}
\value{
Returns a list with three elements: authorities (a vector) of  and hubs (a vector), and number of iterations used.
}
\description{
Hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) is a link analysis algorithm
that is also known as hubs and authorities. It rates nodes by
comparing arrows pointing in and out of nodes in an asymmetrical graph.
}
\details{
Hubs are nodes with a lot of arrows pointing out while authorities are node with a lot of arrows pointing in.
}
\examples{

from <- c("A", "A", "A", "B", "C")
to <- c("B", "C", "D", "D", "E")
hits(adjacency(from, to))
